CLI Flashcards
=============

Simple application I made to practice German but it could be used for
anything. Simply make a .json file and place it in the cards folder 
following the structure of the initial files already present.

Feel free to contribute.

the executable for your OS and place 
it next to your `cards` folder containing 
the json files.
