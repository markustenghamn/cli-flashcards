CLI Flashcards
=============

Simple application I made to practice German but it could be used for
anything. Simply make a .json file and place it in the cards folder 
following the structure of the initial files already present.


To run
------

Clone this project, open a terminal and cd to the project
folder and run `go run main.go`.
